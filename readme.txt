Trustlist
let's you decide who can build and destroy stuff on your server

Only admins are allowed to add/remove players from the trustlist

Commands
/trust <player>
Trusting a player. Player is now able to build and destroy
/untrust <player>
Removes player from list. Player can't build and destroy anymore
/trustlist
Prints the entire list of trusted players and the admin who added them


Untrusted players are unable to perform the following actions:
place,remove or destroy blocks,constructions,objects,chests and vegetations
pickup vegetations
drop or take items out of chests
put items into chests
place or destroy terrain (dirt,stone...)
mowing lawn
hitting or killing other players or NPCs


Once you are added to the list the script doesn't affect you anymore.

NOTE: Even admins have to be trusted before they can do stuff, but they are able to add themselves.
